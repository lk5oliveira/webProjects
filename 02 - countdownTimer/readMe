This project has the goal to create a countdown timer with only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
I tried to make a simple design and create this in less than 1 hour (since I'm a begginer).

I choose as a countdown date my GF's Bday.

In the end of the countdown, this starts all over again for the next year.

The GIF is just for fun (:
